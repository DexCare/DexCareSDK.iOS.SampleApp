ACME is a fictitious health organization. This sample app uses DexCare's iOS Swift SDK to show off some of the functionality of the DexCare SDK.

## How to install

The app uses `Cocoapods` in order to install the the appropriate dependencies. Please follow the directions https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html to get started with cocoapods

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

After cocoapods is installed, simply type in
```
pod install
```
on the command line in the root directory of the project. Once completed open the `DexCareSDK.iOS.SampleApp.xcworkspace` file.

The app should now run correctly.
